### About

Akini is a license that can protect your projects against big tech. For individuals and non-profits it's very similar to the `MIT License`.

- It is human-readable, short and concise.
- It allows users and non-profits alike to freely use your product like they would with a permissive license such as MIT.
- It requires giving credit to the original creator.
- It protects your project against being redistributed or modified by any company.
- It is upgrade-able.

### Usage

The `LICENSE.md` file is being provided in the same directory as the `README.md` file.
You can "copy/paste" the license into your project.

### Contributing

Akini is an open source project made for the benefit of everyone. Contributions are welcomed, as long as they don't take away any user rights. <3

### Security Risks

This license does not recommend using copyright to secure the licensed product. It is an unregistered license and is not legally approved by any government.
